Set of programs which ultimately produce a reduced-variance payoff matrix from samples of a continuous double auction (CDA) simulation.

The pipeline works as follows:
 - GatherResults: collects simulation samples from the Michigan CAEN Advanced Computing cluster. The collected samples are available in /data/samples.zip. It's ~750MB unzipped.
 - CalculateAverageNormalizedUnitValue: name says it all.
 - CalculateAveragePayoffPerStratPerProf: average payoff per strategy per profile.
 - CalculateCoefficients: the 10 control variate coefficients from the average normalized unit values and average payoffs per strategy per profile.
 - CalculateRedVarAvgPayoffPerStratPerProf: produces a payoff matrix which can then be analyzed by an external game analysis script
 - CalculateVarianceReductionRatio: by how much was variance reduced?

The ConvertPayoffMatrix script is used to convert the results of the original study to the format used by the game analysis script.

A detailed explanation of the variance reduction process is available in report.pdf.

The source code for the CDA simulator which produced the samples is available at https://github.com/augie/cda-simulator

The produced JSON payoff matrix is analyzed using the game analysis script available on GitHub at https://github.com/egtaonline/GameAnalysis
